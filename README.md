Meet [Plane](https://plane.so). An open-source software development tool to manage issues, sprints, and product roadmaps with peace of mind 🧘‍♀️.


> Plane Mobile is still in its early days, not everything will be perfect yet, and hiccups may happen. Please let us know of any suggestions, ideas, or bugs that you encounter on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/A92xrEGCge) or GitHub issues, and we will use your feedback to improve on our upcoming releases.

Introducing Plane Mobile, the ultimate tool at your fingertips for managing critical tasks. Our mobile app allows you to effortlessly perform the project-related tasks and effectively manage your projects. Plane Mobile is developed using the latest and most suitable tech stack, which includes Flutter and Dart for the front-end, and Python with Django for the back-end. We rely on PostgreSQL as our primary database and leverage Redis for efficient background task management. To begin using Plane Mobile, get started by exploring our setup section below.
